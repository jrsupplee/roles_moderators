This plugin implements the Moderator role for Elgg via the Roles framework.  More granular access is added to your Elgg site by introducing a new user role: Moderator.

Moderators can:

* Edit or delete other users' content
* View and act on reported content
* Edit the settings and profiles of users
* Ban and unban users
* Reset user passwords
* View the user's Elgg log

To appoint one of your users as a Moderator, first make him/her an admin user, then change this user's role to 'Moderator'.  You can do this by going to the user's settings page.

You must be an admin user to change user roles.

The plugin requires the Roles framework.
